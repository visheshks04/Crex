## Problem Statement

Let's turn the spotlight towards the unfortunate section of the society. The members of such paradigms, devasted by the desparateness for jobs, tend to put up with an inferior wage, as well as unfair treatment in government policies and agents. A big example of the above category, are the blue collared jobs.

<i>For instance, an analysis by paroll management app salarybox of its proprietary database of over a million employed workforce across 850 districs has shown that 65% of the total blue collar employees ear less than 15000 Rs. per month.</i>

On top of this, if people from such unpriveleged class get into an unfortunate situation like a medical issue, their lives become harder as now they won't have a fixed income and most of such people don't even get to keep a lot of savings. They are stuck in a vicious cycle that gets them into debt traps. This is a major concern for their livelihood.

## Solution

Now, loans from banks are hard to get without much of a collateral. In such situations organizations of people can help. An example of it is Self-Help Groups (SHGs) that work by lending money at lower interests to each other and helping each other out when in need.

Our idea is based on such Self-Help Groups where we help such people organize better into communities like Self-Help Groups by providing them with a platform where they can connect with each other and lend money peer-to-peer when in need.
